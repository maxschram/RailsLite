# RailsLite

This a lite web framework with most of the core features of the Ruby on Rails framework

There is also a small webapp built on the framework included in the app folder.
A command for generating new apps is still in progress.

To test out the framework clone the repo and run
`ruby bin/cats_app.rb`
Then navigate to localhost:3000

All of the interesting framework stuff happens in the lib folder
